# Run python script "PD_model1_UKBiobank_Test_datasets_validation3.py"
# to validate PD model-1 with Test datasets derived from UK Biobank PD data.

# There are one set of case data and 30 different sets of control data.
# The python script combines the same case dataset with different control datasets to create 30 Test datasets 
# that are used to evaluate the prediction preformance of PD model-1.
# The 30 AUC validation results are saved in 30_UKBio_PD_AUCs.txt.
