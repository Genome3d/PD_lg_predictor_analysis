# Run python script "PD_model2_UKBiobank_Test_datasets_validation3.py"
# to validate PD model-2 with Test datasets derived from UK Biobank PD data.

# There are one set of case data and 30 different sets of control data.
# The same case dataset were combined with different control datasets to create 30 Test datasets 
# that are used by the python script to evaluate the prediction preformance of PD model-2.
# The 30 AUC validation results are saved in 30_UKBio_PD_AUCs.txt.
